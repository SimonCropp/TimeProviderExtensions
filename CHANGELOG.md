- `ManualTimeProvider` no longer implements on `IDisposable`.
- Moving time forward using `ManualTimeProvider` will now move time forward in steps, stopping at each scheduled timer/callback time, set the internal "UtcNow" clock returned from `GetUtcNow()` invoke the callback, and then progress to the next scheduled timer, until the target "UtcNow" is reached.
